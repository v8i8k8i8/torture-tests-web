Torture test suite for modern web apps — break it before users do.

The **QA Chaos Suite** is a brutally honest, unapologetically weird collection of test cases designed to push your web app to the brink of insanity.

This is not your typical happy-path test suite.  
It’s the **unholy checklist** of every bizarre, forgotten, browser-breaking scenario we’ve seen take down production.

From emoji floods to date field time travel to duplicate tab madness — this repo is where bad ideas become great tests.
